////VISUALIZING FREEFLYER DATA/////

///DESCRIPTION///

A simple python script that can be used to visualize data exported from the simulation software FreeFlyer. Data is in .txt format. A sample data file is included. A second axis can be used to make more complex visualizations.
Moreover, it was deemed useful to include the functionality of reading the epoch text output from FreeFlyer and if needed converting it to a datetime object.
///HOW TO USE///

Place the data file in the same folder as Plot_XY.py, and make sure columns have no headers. Execute the code.
